# PHYS220 CW 10

## Specification

1. Go through the example notebook and code with your group. Discuss and make sure you understand what is happening.
1. Create a new module `estimate_e.py`. Using the fact that $\int_0^1 e^x dx = e - 1$, estimate the value of $e$ using a Monte Carlo technique. (Hint: think about how $\pi$ is estimated in the notebook.) Test your implementation using a test module `test_estimate_e.py` that passes with Travis.
1. Complete the exercise at the bottom of the notebook. Be sure to preserve the existing code such that the rest of the notebook still runs unmodified.

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

It was very interesting to see how the video models could help show what is going on in the xs and ys arrays over time instead of in a snapshot

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
